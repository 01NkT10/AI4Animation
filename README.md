Description
------------
This project extends the recent research of Daniel Holden, Taku Komura and Jun Saito on character control using Phase-Functioned Neural Networks.
As part of my Ph.D. research in this group, I will scientifically continue their research for learning task-specific motion manifolds and representations for different geometries, and make it available for character animation research in Unity3D.
