Description
------------
This project explores the opportunities of deep learning and biologically-inspired optimisation for character animation and control as part of my Ph.D. research at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Informatics, supervised by Taku Komura. The development is done using Unity3D / Tensorflow, and the implementations are made available during my Ph.D. progress.
