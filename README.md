Description
------------
This project explores the opportunities of deep learning and evolutionary computation for character animation as part of my Ph.D. research at the University of Edinburgh. 

It extends the recent research of Daniel Holden, Taku Komura and Jun Saito on character control using Phase-Functioned Neural Networks, and will scientifically continue their research for learning task-specific motion manifolds and representations for different geometries, and make it available for character animation research in Unity3D.
