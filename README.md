Description
------------
This project explores the opportunities of deep learning and biologically-inspired optimisation for character animation and control as part of my Ph.D. research at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Informatics, supervised by Taku Komura. The development is done using Unity3D / Tensorflow, and the implementations are made available during my Ph.D. progress.

SIGGRAPH 2018
------------
Camera-ready version in progress.

SIGGRAPH 2017
------------
This work continues the recent work on PFNN (Phase-Functioned Neural Networks) for character control.

A demo in Unity3D using the original weights for terrain-adaptive locomotion is contained in the Assets/Demo/SIGGRAPH_2017/Original folder.
Another demo on flat ground using the Adam character is contained in the Assets/Demo/SIGGRAPH_2017/Adam folder.
In order to run them, you need to download the neural network weights from the link provided in the Link.txt file, extract them into the /NN folder, 
and store the parameters via the custom inspector button.
