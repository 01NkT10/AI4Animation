Description
------------
This project extends the recent research of Daniel Holden, Taku Komura and Jun Saito on character control using Phase-Functioned Neural Networks.
As part of my Ph.D. research in this group, it will be scientifically continued for learning task-specific motion manifolds and different geometries, and made available for character animation research in Unity3D.
