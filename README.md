Description
------------
This project explores the opportunities of deep learning and evolutionary computation for character animation as part of my Ph.D. research at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Informatics, supervised by Taku Komura.

It extends the recent research of Daniel Holden, Taku Komura and Jun Saito on character control using PFNN (Phase-Functioned Neural Networks), and will scientifically continue their work for learning task-specific motion manifolds and representations for different geometries, and also make it available for character animation research in Unity3D. The code for the PFNN is being implemented using MathNet.Numerics, and uses the externally trained weights from Theano to generate the motion of the characters.
